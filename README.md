scribus-shell-scripts
============

Scribus Project management tools with shell scripts.

Scribus doesnt provide any project management tools. These shell scripts mainly aim to compensate this.

Scripts 
* that help to use scribus in everyday or special uses.
* that make scribus even more powerfull
* that compensate for scribus weaknesses, bugs or lack of features

Rules when proposing scripts for this repo are :
* name of the script should be self-understandable and should give hints as what the script does
* you should provide a detailed description of the intent, required conditions and action of the script, as comments at the script's begining
* scripts should provide help (-h option)
